# Welcome to the Vention Interview!

The goal of this test is to create some interactive cards using HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript.

  

## Rules

- No frameworks. Vanilla JS and CSS/SCSS only (no Bootstrap).

- The layout for the cards should be responsive.

- Provide access to your code, e.g. link to a GitHub repo.

-  **Important**: The card data should be stored in JS (e.g. mocked API response).

- Thatâ€™s it!

  

## What to Build

The card states are shown below. The image should fade and a button should appear when the card is hovered

over. When an item is added to the cart, an icon should appear on the top left-hand corner of the card indicating that

it has been added to the cart. A new button should now appear allowing you to remove the item from the cart, which

resets the card back to its original state.

  

## Card States

## Things to Improve
- Review routes for add to cart.
- Add CSS transitions to cart status badge.
- Improve data validation and sanitization.
- Refactor drag and drop controls.
- Add image processing to give image correct aspect ratio.
